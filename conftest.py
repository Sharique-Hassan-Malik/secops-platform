"""Make every module importable when pytest runs from the repository root.

Each module folder under `modules/` is its own source root — that is what lets
it be run standalone from its own directory. Collecting all of their tests in
one pytest run therefore needs each of those folders on `sys.path`, which is
what this does.

Without it, `pytest` from the root fails to collect while `cd modules/<name> &&
pytest` passes, which is a confusing way to find out about the layout.
